# VanillaPlus

Have you always wanted to improve your Minecraft Vanilla experience without changing too much? Then you've come to the
right place! This plugin adds recipes for almost every item, adds furnace recipes to melt your tools and armor, allows
you to mine spawners and much more.

This plugin is currently only tested with Minecraft version 1.20.4 on CraftBukkit, Spigot and Paper.

All important things such as installation and the use of commands and permissions can be found in
the [wiki](https://github.com/Gaming12846/VanillaPlus/wiki).

## Features

### General

- **Highly customizable plugin configuration** - You can configure or deactivate all modules individually
- **Fully customizable language configuration** - You can translate any message and description into the language of
  your choice (pre-translated language is English)

### Modules

- **Crafting recipes** - Adds 78 recipes to Minecraft for normally uncraftable items
- **Furnace recipes** - Adds 55 recipes to Minecraft for melting and blasting items, tools and armor
- **Spawner** - Adds the possibility to mine spawners with the corresponding mobs
- **Enchanting** - Adds the ability to remove the need for lapis lazuli for enchantment

## Notes
